## Assumptions or design decisions

1. A one-to-many unidirectional relationship is implemented from Order to Product, since a single order can include multiple products.

2. The Order entity is mapped to multiple Product entities using a one-to-many unidirectional association, reflecting the real-world scenario where an order can have many products.
